					<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
					<p><strong>The sale includes Citibank’s consumer banking and investment business, consumer loans and cards businesses, and the CitiBusiness microenterprise accounts, and it has been approved by the National Bank of Hungary and the Hungarian Competition Authority to take place on 3 February 2017.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>The process of transfer of the consumer customer accounts (related contracts, data and settings) will take place on the weekend starting	4 February 2017.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>The transfer of consumer customer accounts will take place automatically.</strong> Erste Bank’s contractual terms and conditions will go into effect on the day of the transfer of customer accounts.

					<p><strong>In January 2017 we will be sending you detailed information, in a separate letter and email</strong>, on the schedule that will apply over the weekend of the customer-account transfer and on any further changes.</p>
					<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW</strong></p>
					<p>Please find here the most important things you need to know in relation to the transfer of customer accounts. <strong>You will find detailed information in the letter sent to you by Citibank in November 2016.</strong></p>
					<p>Please note that we will only be able to notify you of the changes that concern you in time if your mailing address and your email address are correctly	recorded in our systems. <strong>If there is a change in your contact details, we ask that you notify us via CitiPhone Banking, on +36 1 288 8888, on working days between 8 a.m. and 8	p.m.</strong></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong><u>Account management, time deposits</u></strong></p>
					<p>The conditions of your Citibank current account fee package valid at the time of the transfer of customer accounts <strong>will remain unchanged or will be more favourable</strong> after the transfer of customer accounts.</p>
					<p>After the transfer of customer accounts <strong>your account numbers will change. </strong>Please find the new account number in the letter sent to you by Citibank in November 2016 and/or in the letter we will send you in <strong>January 2017.</strong></p>
					<p>We would like to ask you that you please notify your partners that you are expecting payments from (e.g. your employer) about the change in your current	account number.</p>
					<p>The family-support allowances (e.g. family benefit, gyes, gyet, maternity support), and the pensions and pension-type allowances will automatically be paid to the new account number after the transfer of customer accounts. <strong>The new account number will be activated after the takeover of the customer accounts. Before that date, it will not be possible to execute any transactions to or from the new account number (deposit, withdrawal, incoming or outgoing transfers).</strong></p>
					<p>Your <strong>time deposits fixed at Citibank will continue to earn interest at unchanged terms </strong>until they mature. Automatically renewed deposits will be renewed at the terms offered by Erste Bank following the transfer of customer accounts.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong><u>Debit cards</u></strong></p>
					<p>After the transfer of customer accounts, you will be able to	<strong>use your new debit card issued by Erste Bank in place of your current Citibank debit card.</strong> Erste Bank will send your new debit card in a separate mail in <strong>January 2017</strong>.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong><u>Overdrafts</u></strong></p>
					<p>It will remain a condition for the continued maintenance of your overdraft limit that your requisite minimum income be regularly transferred, each month, to your current account. We would like to ask you that you please inform your employer in time that from 4 February 2017. your income should be transferred to the new account number. <strong>The new account number will be activated after the takeover of the customer accounts. Before that date, it will not be possible to make transfers to the new account number.</strong></p>
					<p>After the transfer of customer accounts, your overdraft limit, available on the basis of your present overdraft facility contract, the annual rate of interest, fees or charges will remain unchanged.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong><u>Investment products</u></strong></p>
					<p>In the Erste Group, activities related to the trading of securities, including account management, are performed by Erste Investment Limited, so after the transfer of customer accounts, the securities deposited on your securities accounts kept at Citibank will be transferred to new securities accounts at Erste Investment Limited. The <strong>account numbers of the securities accounts will change</strong>; the new account numbers are specified in the letter sent to you by Citibank in November 2016 and/or will be provided in the letter that we will be sending to you in <strong>January 2017</strong>.</p>
					<p>Erste’s procedures for the recording of the investment portfolio and securities accounts differ in some respect from those applied at Citibank.</p>
					<p>At Citibank you currently have different types of securities accounts for the various different investment products.	<strong>Erste Investment Limited will record all the different investment products on a single securities account in accordance with the given contractual relationship. All your Citibank securities accounts that have the same Authorised Persons will be combined in a single account, opened with a single account number, at Erste Investment Limited</strong>. A cash account will also be linked to your securities accounts opened at Erste Investment Limited. <strong>The settlement of investment transactions and of the associated costs will take place through the crediting and debiting of this cash account.</strong> This also means that while until now you have been able to launch investment transactions directly from your current account at Citibank, after the transfer of customer accounts you will only be able to do this through your cash account held at Erste Investment Limited, and not directly on your current account held at Erste Bank. Accordingly,  <strong>in order to purchase investments, first you will need to transfer the amount that you want to invest from your current account kept at Erste Bank to	the cash account</strong>.</p>
					<p>The <strong>account management fee </strong>for the securities account <strong>will remain unchanged.</strong></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong><u>Credit cards</u></strong></p>
					<p>As part of the process of transferring customer accounts, and to ensure continuity of card use,	<strong>your current Citibank credit card will be replaced by a new credit card, issued by Erste Bank.</strong> Erste Bank will send your new credit card in a separate mail in <strong>January 2017</strong>.
					</p>
					<p><strong>The interests and fees associated with the new credit card(s) will remain the same</strong> as the interests and fees associated with your current Citibank credit card(s).</p>
					<p>Your new <strong>credit card number and the account number will change</strong> after the transfer of customer accounts; after this, you will have to pay your credit card debt (or at least the minimum payable amount) to the new account number. Please find the new account number in the letter sent to you by Citibank in November 2016 and/or in the letter we will send you in <strong>January 2017. The new account number will be activated after the takeover of the customer accounts. Before that date, it will not be possible to make deposits (payments) to the new account number.</strong> If you want to give any one-off payment orders for execution with a value date that is after the transfer of customer accounts, then please specify the new credit card account number.</p>
					<p>The dates on which the account statements for the new credit cards are issued (billing date) may differ from the current ones.</p>
					<p>If you exceed your credit limit set for your Citibank credit card, we would like to ask you that you please pay off the amount that is in excess of the credit limit by 11:59 p.m 3 February 2017.</p>
					<p>If, at the time of the transfer of customer accounts, you have any Installment Payment Services (Automatic Equal Payment Plan, Equal Payment Plan, Loan on Phone) linked to your Citibank credit card account, the interest(s) and fees related to such services will remain the same as the interest(s) and fees associated with your current setup of Installment Payment Services.</p>
					<p>If, at the time of the transfer of customer accounts, your Citibank credit card has an Advanced Loan on Phone service linked to it, this	<strong>will be set on your Erste credit card under the name Loan on Phone service</strong>, and the credit limit on your Erste credit card may be higher than the limit on your current Citibank credit card. We will be informing you of the precise amount of the credit limit in <strong>January 2017</strong>, in a separate letter.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong><u>Personal Line of Credit / Personal Instalment Loan</u></strong></p>
					<p>After the transfer of customer accounts the <strong>annual interest and monthly instalments</strong> of your Personal Line of Credit / Personal Instalment Loan, fees and charges <strong>will remain unchanged</strong>.</p>
					<p><strong>Your loan-servicing account number will change</strong> after the transfer of customer accounts; after this, you will need to ensure that the amount needed to make the monthly payments on your Personal Line of Credit / Personal Instalment Loan is available on your new account. Please find the new account number in the present letter and/or in the letter we will send you in <strong>January 2017. The new account number will be activated after the takeover of the customer accounts. Before that date, it will not be possible to make deposits	(payments) to the new account number.</strong></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong><u>Mortgages</u></strong></p>
					<p>After the transfer of customer accounts <strong>the interest calculation, the monthly instalments of your Mortgage, its fees and charges will remain unchanged.</strong></p>
